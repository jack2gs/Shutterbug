Shutterbug that supports iOS 8

Origin from the Stanford iOS 7 Course **CS193p**: **Developing Apps for iOS**, Lecture 11. I get it supporting iOS 8 by using size Classes and auto layout.

It can't work before you set **your own Flickr API key**. Tips: you can get it done in **FlickrAPIKey.h**

And I also have written an article about this, [使用iOS 8的新特性实现Shutterbug](http://www.jianshu.com/p/98e337cc7fc9). Hope it's helpful. :)
